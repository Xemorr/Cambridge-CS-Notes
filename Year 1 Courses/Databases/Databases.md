# Databases
Databases is one of the first courses taken in Computer Science at Cambridge.

## What is a database management system? (DBMS)



## Databases focuses on three specific data models
### [[Relational Model]]
 Data is stored in tables (SQL).
 
### [[Aggregate-oriented Model]]
Document Oriented Database, optimised for read speeds, worse for writing.

### [[Graph-oriented Model]] 
The data is stored as a graph. Query languages have to think in terms of paths.

## The three database systems used

### HyperSQL
A Java-based relational database management system using traditional SQL.

### DOCtor Who
A bespoke document-oriented collection of data, it isn't really a database management system, it is really just some python dictionaries behaving like a DBMS!

### Neo4j
A graph-oriented java database management system. This languages used [[Cypher]] for querying.
