# CAP
What is the CAP Principle?

In a highly distributed system:
Assume that network partitions and other connectivity problems will occur.
Implementing ACID transactions is very difficult and slow.
You are left engineering a trade-off between availability and consistency.

In a CAP system, it will eventually become consistent.
